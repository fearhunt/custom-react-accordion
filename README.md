# Custom React Accordion

![accordion screenshot](accordion-app.png)

**Component Brief:** The first item 
of the accordion should be open by default. The active item should also close automatically if another item is selected. Instead of hardcoding the content, it would be great if the app included JSON formatted data. 

**Extra points** The accordion should meet a high standard of accessibility, and the opening and closing be controlled using keyboard input (the up and down arrows).
